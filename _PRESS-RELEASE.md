There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  > Easy Project Management

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  > Easy to use project outlines, keeping track of hours, and ability to create invoices and estimates.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  > When starting on a new project you usually have to end up creating an estimate for the client. With Easy Project Management you only have to enter the tasks needed to be done and based off previous projects it will generate an estimate including the goal, total time, and cost to the client. Then it will create a list of tasks for you to do with useful organization tools to keep you productive. You can then setup a time based on whether the client wants to be invoiced monthly, weekly, etc to have the invoice generated for you and sent to them automatically.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  > Keeping track of the hours you spent on a specific project can be tedious and hard. Especially if the client wants to know in detail what you accomplished during the day. The challenge comes when they ask for an estimate, which is really hard because in the end you don't really know how long it is going to take you and what task are going to be needed to be done.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  > To solve this the program will provide tools for keeping you productive while you work on the project. With integration with git and your favorite editor. It will slowly learn over time what tools you prefer to use and how long it takes to complete certain tasks. So that way generating estimates are as easy as asking a few questions. Afterwards you will use the task management list to help you with useful organization tools as your work towards completion. It will then send emails periodically based on what your for the project to the client with an invoice based off of what you completed.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  > We have been using this internally for a while now. It has helped us greatly with creating more accurate estimates and productivity, thus we now have happier and longer relationships with clients.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  > To get started it is as easy as signing up and downloading a tool. Then use that tool to create projects and get started on working on it.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  > This has helped as drastically improve productivity and create better relationships with our clients.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  > We hope that Easy Project Management will increase your productivity and improve relationships with clients so that you can continue to do what you love. To get started head to [Easy Project Management](http://camel-project-management.meteor.com).
